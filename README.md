## Project Goals<a name="goals"></a>

The goal of this project was to explore the possibility of using thematic analysis and sentiment analysis to build a model to predict a categorical variable assoicated with a free-from text review. Using a dataset I found on Kaggle of 42,000 Disneyland reviews that were webscrapped from the Trip Advisor website, I hypothesized that a k nearest neighbors model could predict a categorical variable associated with each reivew with reasonable accuracy.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

This repository contains one juptyer notebook with the code pertaining to the analysis of the project goals above.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
